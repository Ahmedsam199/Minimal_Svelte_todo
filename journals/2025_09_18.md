- Making out routing with svelte and its actually like next tried to make an async request then filter this data using an input
- started with creating Interface for the data i will receive from the api
- fetching the data inside a variable using the onMount Function that will fetch the data on start of the app
- using the $derived to filter the data that it will normally watch the data changing from its decencies
  and re render when the search term variable will change
